## Welcome to the Juris Community

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Juris! Your engagement and feedback are invaluable as we build the future of computational UI composition.

## Current Contribution Model

Juris is currently in a **foundational architecture phase** where we are establishing unopinionated, first-principle driven design patterns. During this critical period, **direct code contributions are not being accepted** to ensure architectural coherence and maintain the project's core philosophy.

### Why This Approach?

**First-Principle Thinking**  
Juris is built on fundamental computational principles rather than accumulated conventions. This requires careful, deliberate architectural decisions that stem from core truths about reactive systems, performance optimization, and developer experience.

**Unopinionated Architecture**  
We're establishing patterns that don't impose specific methodologies or frameworks on developers, allowing maximum flexibility in how Juris is used while maintaining internal consistency.

**Return to Source**  
Rather than building on top of existing paradigms, Juris returns to the essential nature of UI as computational structures, requiring a clean-slate approach to architecture.
